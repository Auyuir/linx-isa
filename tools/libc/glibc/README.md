# Legacy glibc bring-up assets

Historical glibc bring-up scripts originally lived in `tools/glibc/`.
The active workflow now uses:

- `tools/libc/apply-glibc-patches.sh`
- `tools/libc/build-glibc.sh`
- `tools/libc/patches/glibc/*.patch`

This folder is reserved for glibc-specific helper assets when needed.
