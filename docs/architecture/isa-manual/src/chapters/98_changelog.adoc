=== v0.1 (draft) — 2026-02-06

**ISA catalog / encodings**

* Corrected the `FENCE.D` assembly operand name to `pred_imm` (was `perd_imm` in the draft tables).

**Manual / generated reference**

* Defined `TPC` and `BPC` terminology for PC-relative formulas and exception capture.
* Expanded Block ISA documentation with block header descriptor guidance (`B.IOR/B.IOT/B.ATTR/B.HINT/...`).
* Expanded memory chapter with endianness guidance and fence/ordering overview.
* Improved informative pseudocode in the generated instruction descriptions for:
  - `B.DIM` (shows `LB0/LB1/LB2` behavior),
  - `B.*` descriptor families (named operations instead of generic metadata),
  - execution-control and privileged instructions (`ASSERT`, `EBREAK`, `FENCE.*`, `ACRE/ACRC`).
* Privileged architecture alignment (from golden sources under `isa/golden/v0.1/`):
** Rewrote the system/privilege chapter to define the v0.1 ACR model (up to 16 rings in a tree rooted at ACR0),
   `ACR_ENTER`/`SERVICE_REQUEST` flows, and `ACRC` routing.
** Updated the curated SSR table (`system_registers_ssr.adoc`) to match the v0.1 draft system-register IDs and to
   document 12-bit vs 24-bit SSR ID encodings (`SSRGET` vs `HL.SSRGET`) (including `CYCLE = 0x0C00`).
** Renamed the block commit argument state from CARG to BARG across the manual to match the draft naming.
