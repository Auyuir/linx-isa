==== System Status Registers (SSR)

The following **System Status Registers (SSR)** are defined by the v0.1 privilege/system draft.
Unless noted, SSR values are **XLEN** wide and are accessed with the SSR access instructions.

SSR access instructions:

* `SSRGET` / `SSRSET` / `SSRSWAP` (32-bit forms) encode a **12-bit** `SSR_ID[11:0]`.
* `HL.SSRGET` / `HL.SSRSET` (48-bit forms) encode a **24-bit** `SSR_ID[23:0]` and are used when the full SSR ID does
  not fit in 12 bits (e.g. `0x1F10`).
* `C.SSRGET` (16-bit) reads a small set of commonly used registers; its `SSRID` encoding is a profile-defined remap.

|SSR_ID |Name |Description

|`0x0000` |`TP` |Thread pointer (TLS base).
|`0x0001` |`GP` |Global pointer (global data base).

|`0x0010` |`TIME` |Timer counter.
|`0x0C00` |`CYCLE` |Cycle counter.

|`0x0020` |`CSTATE` |Common state (privilege + execution state). See <<system-service-request>>.
|`0x0021` |`LXLCID` |Linx logical core ID.
|`0x0022` |`VENDOR` |Vendor ID.
|`0x0023` |`VERSION` |Core version.
|`0x0024` |`LCFR` |Core feature description (includes `LaneNum`).
|`0x0025` |`LCFR_EN` |Core feature enable.

NOTE: The v0.1 draft reserves `0x0050..0x005F` for loop-control registers used by parallel/loop blocks.

==== Manager-ACR (privileged) SSR families

Privileged SSRs are addressed using IDs of the form `SSR_ID = 0x n f xx` (16-bit), where `n` is the manager ACR ID.

In the v0.1 privilege model:

* These SSRs MUST be accessible from **ACR0** and **ACR1**.
* Accesses from other ACRs MAY be ignored or MAY raise `E_ISSR` (illegal-SSR trap), depending on the platform profile.

Use `HL.SSRGET/HL.SSRSET` when the full `SSR_ID` does not fit in 12 bits.
